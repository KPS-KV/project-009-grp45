    "In this analysis, we investigated whether a player's age and the number of hours they play the game can predict their subscription to a game-related newsletter using K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we cleaned the dataset by dropping irrelevant columns: \"name\", \"hashedEmail\", \"gender\" and experience\" as they are not conceptually related to the question being investigated. We also dropped rows with \"NA\" to make the dataset ready for K-NN classification because a dataset with rows that contain \"NA\" would cause errors in the classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then standardized the subscription labels to use \"Yes/No\" instead of \"TRUE/FALSE\" as it is more more easily understood and reduces ambiguity. We also scaled both predictor variables to make sure the distance metric for K-NN uses them with equal weighting.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then made explanatory summaries and visualizations to understand data patterns before the modeling and classification. This helped us gain a rough idea of what the expected outcome could be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we split the data into training and testing data into 75% and 25% respectively. Using the training dataset, we determined the most effective K value. We did this by using a range of K values and gathering information on their accuracies and generating a plot to visualize this information. We chose the optimal K value for this classification problem based on highest accuracy and then performed the classification in the testing set using this K value to generate predictions for the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we analysed performance by generating a confusion matrix from which we evaluated accuracy and classification. Using the obtained information, we made a heatmap to summarize how accurate the model was at differentiating subscribers and non-subscribers. These results were then used to answer the original question."

    "This tells us that the model is better at predicting positives than it is negatives. The model correctly predicted 33 of 36 subscribers but only 5 of 13 non-subscribers. This is likely because of the fact that there are many more subscribers than non-subscribers in the complete data set, causing the model to be stronger when predicting the majority class.
