    "In this analysis, we investigated whether a player's age and the number of hours they play the game can predict their subscription to a game-related newsletter using K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we cleaned the dataset by dropping irrelevant columns: \"name\", \"hashedEmail\", \"gender\" and experience\" as they are not conceptually related to the question being investigated. We also dropped rows with \"NA\" to make the dataset ready for K-NN classification because a dataset with rows that contain \"NA\" would cause errors in the classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then standardized the subscription labels to use \"Yes/No\" instead of \"TRUE/FALSE\" as it is more more easily understood and reduces ambiguity. We also scaled both predictor variables to make sure the distance metric for K-NN uses them with equal weighting. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then made explanatory summaries and visualizations to understand data patterns before the modeling and classification. This helped us gain a rough idea of what the expected outcome could be. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we split the data into training and testing data into 75% and 25% respectively. Using the training dataset, we determined the most effective *K* value. We did this by using a range of *K* values and gathering information on their accuracies and generating a plot to visualize this information. We chose the optimal *K* value for this classification problem based on highest accuracy and then performed the classification in the testing set using this *K* value to generate predictions for the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we analysed performance by generating a confusion matrix from which we evaluated accuracy and classification. Using the obtained information, we made a heatmap to summarize how accurate the model was at differentiating subscribers and non-subscribers. These results were then used to answer the original question. "
